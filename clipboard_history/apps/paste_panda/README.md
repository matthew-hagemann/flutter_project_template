# Paste Panda

Paste Panda is a clipboard manager that allows you to save and manage your
clipboard history.

It is supposed to serve as reference workspace for Flutter developers at
Canonical to learn so that the patterns and packages used in here can be used
in other projects too, to make sure that we are consistent in our codebases.

Read the general [README](../../README.md) of this repository for more
information about the packages and practices that we use.
